# My Python Programs

This repository contains simple programs developed during my initial Python studies.  
The focus is on learning best practices, programming logic, and code organization.

## Programs Included

- Dollar exchange rate conversion
- Sphere volume calculation
- Freight calculation
- Variable swapping
- Brick quantity calculation for walls
- And other basic exercises for practice

## Objective

Practice transitioning algorithms to Python and develop a solid foundation with best practices for future use in systems such as TMS (Transportation Management System).

## In Progress

This repository will be continuously updated with new exercises, comments, and code improvements.
